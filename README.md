## Description
* This repository contains a Python implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. 
* PSO is a computational method used for optimizing a wide range of functions by simulating the social behavior of birds within a flock. 
* It is widely used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other computational fields for solving optimization problems.

## Installation
* To use the ABC algorithm, clone this repository and install the required dependencies.

## Contributing
* Feel free to fork this repository, make improvements, and submit pull requests. Your contributions are welcome!
