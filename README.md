## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO is a computational method used for optimizing a wide range of functions by simulating the social behavior of birds within a flock. It is widely used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other computational fields for solving optimization problems.

## Installation Instructions:


For detailed setup instructions and execution, refer to the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).
