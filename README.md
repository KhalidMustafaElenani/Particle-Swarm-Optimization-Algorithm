## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm. PSO is a computational method used for optimizing a wide range of functions by simulating the social behavior of birds within a flock. It is widely used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other computational fields for solving optimization problems.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/KhalidMustafaElenani/Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Algorithm.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Particle-Swarm-Optimization-Algorithm

## Usage Examples
  - Run the PSO algorithm by executing the main.py file: python main.py



For detailed setup instructions and execution, refer to the [NOTES.md](NOTES.md).
