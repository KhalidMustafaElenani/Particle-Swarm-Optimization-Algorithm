## Description
This repository contains a Python implementation of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm.
PSO is a computational method used for optimizing a wide range of functions by simulating the social behavior of birds within a flock.
It is widely used in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and other computational fields for solving optimization problems.
